# michaeldemar.co

Personal website built in React. Optimized for resuability, reading all personal data from a JavaScript object (interpreted as JSON data). Constantly updated to be even prettier and more user-friendly. Have feedback? Email me@michaeldemar.co.

This website is no longer in use, but I'll leave it on my Github anyhow. Check out my new website [here]()!
